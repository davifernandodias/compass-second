Yo, welcome! This is a chill full-stack project rocking a **Next.js** frontend and an **Express.js** backend.

## Three Challenger Compass

This repoâ€™s split into two main squads:

- **Frontend**: A Next.js app with that sweet server-side and client-side rendering combo.
- **Backend**: A laid-back RESTful API built with Express.js, hooked up to a PostgreSQL database.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: React framework bringing the server-side and client-side magic.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: Utility-first CSS vibes for fast, clean, and responsive designs.
- **[Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)**: Lightweight state management thatâ€™s chill and easy to roll with.

### Backend
- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**: Node.js framework for whipping up RESTful APIs like a pro.
- **[Drizzle ORM](https://drizzle.team/)**: TypeScript ORM to keep database chats smooth and simple.
- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Solid relational database holding all the data down.
